University project for "Software engineering 2" exam: deep analysis and documentation for building a new application.

I and my colleague produced the Requirements Analysis and Specification Documentation (RASD) + Design Document (DD) for a new application, meant for wearable devices, that detect anomalies in vital parameters and directly calls for help if needed.
We also provided formal analysis using Alloy language.
